###Description
The ultra sonic sensor mounted on the blind cane senses any object that's placed in a given direction. A micro controller is programmed such that it will read the sensor data and triggers a message of an object is within 90cm at the direction the blind cane points. The message is then transmitted to a computer which is then sent to the smart myo arm band. The myo arm band will provide haptic feedback to the blind person. 

Making the communication path precise and reliable was very challenging. The myo reading a message made by an external controller was challenging to implement. The haptic feedback accuracy strongly matters to the blind person.
